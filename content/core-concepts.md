# Core Concepts

Water Framework is built around several core concepts that make it powerful and flexible:

## Component-Based Architecture

The framework uses a component-based architecture where each piece of functionality is encapsulated in a component. Components can be discovered, registered, and managed through the Component Registry.

## Framework Agnostic

Water Framework is designed to work with multiple underlying frameworks. Currently, it supports:

- Spring Boot
- OSGi

## Security First

Security is built into the core of the framework, with a unified security model that works across different implementations.
